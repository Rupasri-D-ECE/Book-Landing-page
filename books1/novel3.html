        <h2>The Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Do It Today is one of the best books I have read on beating procrastinating, improving Productivity, and achieving more with a finite time.
<br>
Darius claims having clear goals is of immense help when it comes to Productivity; however, later in the book, he also suggests that it’s OK if one is not clear of a goal at all times. Things happen, life happens, and we don’t have to beat ourselves up.
<br>
The book is divided into three parts – 1) Overcome Procrastination, 2) How to Improve Productivity, and 3) How to Achieve More.
