 Success is not an absence of problem, it is overcoming them.
 When we eat too much, we make a choice to be overweight.
 We are all free to the point of making choices. But after we make a choice the choice controls the chooser.
 A burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishment.
 <br>

 In order to support physically and emotionally one needs to be strong both physically and emotionally.
 Feeling good is a natural outcome of doing good and doing good is a natural outcome of being good.
<br>
 Technology and technicians you can always buy with money, but the wealthiest person must build relationships.
 People don’t care how much you know, they want to know how much you care.
When you are good to others, you are best to yourself.

 Excellence is not an act but a habit.
 Only perfect practice makes perfect.
 The habit starts by being too weak to be felt and ends up becoming too strong to be broken.
So long as you have your eyes on the goal, you don’t see obstacles.
When you don’t know where you are going, any road will take you there.
Our short term and mid-term goals must lead us to our purpose to achieve what is called alignment.
